Welcome

I create this repo to store the artifacts used in my presentation at the OWASP Toronto Chapter. Here you will find the presentation slides and the step by step instructions to reproduce the demo I presented. 

Companies are constantly seeking new and innovative ways to stay ahead in a highly competitive and rapidly changing business landscape. One strategy that has proven to be highly effective is application modernization. This is not just a mere upgrade; it is a complete transformation of how businesses operate. By embracing this approach, companies can accelerate innovation, optimize costs, and improve their overall security posture. 

However, embarking on the journey of application modernization is not an easy task. It requires a significant investment in people, processes, and technology to achieve the desired business outcomes. The right foundation must be established from the beginning to avoid the high cost of re-architecture, which can be a major roadblock in achieving success. One crucial aspect is developing a standard and scalable security design for their Kubernetes environment. This will establish the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives. 

In conclusion, application modernization is a strategic initiative that can transform businesses. Developing a standard and scalable security design for the Kubernetes environment is critical to establishing the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.
